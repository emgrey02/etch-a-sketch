# Etch-a-sketch
### a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)'s Responsive Web Design curriculum
An online etch-a-sketch, where the user can click and drag to sketch. Drawing options are turning each pixel black, a random color, or a color 10% darker than before. The user can also erase their work with the "Clear Grid" button or the "erase" option.
